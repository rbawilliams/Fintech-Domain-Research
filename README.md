# THE EMERGENCE OF PROJECT JASPER: THE FUTURE OF MONEY AND PAYMENTS 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## BACKGROUND 

Although <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/about/history/"> the Bank of Canada</a> was founded in 1934 as Canada’s central bank, its operations commenced in 1935, as a privately owned institution, with shares sold to the public. By 1938, the Bank became a Crown corporation belonging to the federal government of Canada; it became publicly owned and remains so today.  <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/about/history/"> Bank note </a> operations were transferred from the Department of Finance when the Bank opened, and the offices of the Receiver General across the country became the agencies of the Bank. According to *the Bank of Canada Act*, the Bank exists **“to regulate credit and currency in the best interests of the economic life of the nation.”** Currently, the Bank of Canada is led by the Governing Council. This council is made up of the Governor, the Senior Deputy Governor, and the Deputy Governors. The Governing Council's primary tool for conducting monetary policy is the **policy interest rate**.

**Core Functions**

    •	Monetary Policy
    •	Financial Systems
    •	Currency
    •	Funds Management
    •	Retail Payments Supervision

Efforts towards Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) has grown globally. This is in part a reaction to the **COVID-19 crisis** which prompted a shift in payment habits `images-commerce, digital, and contactless payments` because of the fear of virus transmission via bank notes. Another reason for the shift is the value gained and significant developments in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In response, over <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/central-banks-are-embracing-digital-currencies-will-the-us-lead-or-follow/"> 85 countries </a>, Canada included, have started exploring CBDC. On that note, the Bank of Canada has designed several projects to help prepare them for the future of money and payments. One such project is the issuance of a CBDC named **Project Jasper**.

## PROJECT 'JASPER' 


Project Jasper is a joint research initiative by the Bank of Canada, Payments Canada, financial innovation consortium R3 and a number of Canadian financial institutions to understand how distributed ledger technol¬ogy (DLT) could change the future of payments in Canada. In March 2016, Project Jasper was launched, with three phases in the exploration of DLT completed to date (Payments Canada, Bank of Canada and R3, 2016).

><a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/fsr-june-2017-chapman.pdf"> "The project entails two distinct DLT platforms – an R3 Corda platform and an Ethereum platform – as well as developing some aspects of the primary functionality characteristic to wholesale interbank settlement systems prevalent today (Payments Canada, Bank of Canada and R3, 2016)."the Bank of Canada</a> 

The second phase is specifically focused on successfully building a liquidity-saving mechanism (LSM).  The LSM is in the form of a central queue on top of the latter platform to help economize on liquidity and promote smooth intraday flow of payment transactions across the platform (Chapman et al., 2017; Payments Canada, Bank of Canada and R3, 2016). Based on the analysis presented, so far, the DLT platforms that use a “proof-of-work” consensus protocol was developed in `Phase 1`. The findings indicate that they **do not** deliver the needed low operational risk or settlement finality expected of core settlement systems. To mitigate against this, `Phase 2` built a distributed ledger system that employed an alternative consensus model on the basis of a *notary node”* (Payments Canada, Bank of Canada and R3, 2016). **The intent here is to deliver improvements to scalability, settlement finality and privacy**. 

Fast forward to 2017, and Project Jasper has entered `Phase 3`. The project has added another collaborator - **TMX Group (Toronto’s stock exchange operator)**. Phase 3 will be building on the first 2 phases while ***integrating securities with payments*** (Chapman et al., 2017). Also, it will build a proof of concept for the clearing and settlement of securities through the central bank cash-on-ledger model. To take advantage of DLT’s ability to create ***atomic “Delivery vs Payment” transactions***, the platform seeks to discover greater efficiency by automating the securities settlement process (Chapman et al., 2017). In other words, it is expected that a simultaneous exchange of ownership of an asset and its payment will occur without a third-party escrow agent or any time lags. More importantly, the platform should limit the risk of one transaction failing while the other succeeds.

It is important to note that the project is still ongoing, and the team continues to work on improving the ability of a DLT platform to observe the international *Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures* (PFMIs) that must be met by a distributed ledger wholesale interbank payments settlement system. Arguably, `Phase 4` was launched some time in 2017, with a cross border testing with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Bank of England (*Atlantic Council*, 2022). At the time of this research, no concrete findings of this test were available.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS 

Perfunctory research has indicated that different central banks are driven by varying and competing factors for deploying DLT. The diversity is broad and wide-reaching. However, there are some commonalities: the need to provide a central bank alternative to bank deposits and physical cash notes, to control domestic corruption, to upgrade old systems, and to drive international monetary relevance (*Atlantic Council*, 2022). 

>Central banks in other regions are generally interested in distributed ledgers’ potential to increase resiliency for domestic payment systems that will include <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/10/project-jasper-lessons-from-bank-of-canadas-first-blockchain-project/"> real time gross settlement systems</a> (Opare & Kim, 2020). 

Moreover, they are interested in risk reducing atomic “delivery vs payment” (domestic and cross border) that distributed ledgers can support. This includes getting cash on ledger to make these efficiencies possible.

Another takeaway derived from the research is that there is a widening access to the central bank balance sheets (Chapman et al., 2017). This essentially means that more participants should be enabled to hold real sovereign in digital form. As is seen with Project Jasper, especially in Phase 2, is that although LSMs are well understood to work well in a traditional centralized real time gross settlement systems, there is an even greater potential to work more efficiently in a decentralized model. This is due to the large amounts of data in banks as opposed to a centralized RTGS platform.

The most glaring commonality is that **central banks across the globe are examining public cryptocurrency blockchain technologies and then <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/10/project-jasper-lessons-from-bank-of-canadas-first-blockchain-project/"> transitioning into Corda </a>**. Simply because, Corda was engineered and designed from inception to meet the needs of a regulated financial institution.

## RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based on research, it is apparent that the Bank of Canada and Project Jasper have achieved a deeper understanding of how the private sector might interact with and adapt to DLT systems. However, **there are two shortcomings** – the initial design is collateral intensive and in actuality, the trade-offs between how widely information is shared and how data and transactions are verified by members of the system will need to be resolved (Opare & Kim, 2020). There are ways to circumvent these shortcomings. 

They are:

    1. Create more savings by building other applications on top of the core cash payment distributed ledger system. Some examples of this are trade finance or financial asset clearing and settlement. 

    2. A significant amount of centralization. For example, setting of operational standards or 'permissioning' of nodes when applied to wholesale payments systems.
